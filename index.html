                    <p>I'm a third-year software development student with over five years of experience in distribution,
                    management, and training. My experience has helped cultivate adaptability in handling unexpected
                    situations and devising effective solutions. I think adaptability is essential in the software field in
                        order to accommodate clients requests. </p>
                        <p>I have worked with languages like Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I
                    have also completed a project which analyzed various aspects of carbon footprints using Excel and
                    Python. I'm currently looking for a summer internship, ideally to work on the back end of applications
                    or working with databases. Please take a look around and feel free to add me on LinkedIn! </p>
